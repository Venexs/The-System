## 3. Local-Only Use of Data

Any information you input (e.g., preferences, reminders, exercises) remains strictly on your device. This data is used **only by the App** to algorithmically generate exercises, notifications, and reminders â€” and is never seen, stored, or transmitted to the app developers or third parties.

## 4. No Ads, No Trackers

The App contains **no advertisements**, and we do **not use any third-party analytics**, tracking services, or cookies.

You have full control over any data stored by the App. You can delete or modify your data at any time from within the appâ€™s settings or by clearing its storage.
