# The System (Solo Levelling)
This is just a fun project I made, trying to emulate and fulfil the function that The 'System' in Solo Levelling had. (THIS IS JUST A TESTING VERSION!)

Context:

In the Anime/Manga/Light Novel, Solo Levelling, The MC has a screen only he can see that allows him to 'Level Up' his Physical Attributes such as, Strength, Agility, Vitality, Perception and Intellect. 

This Program is made to simulate that system by helping the user get motivation to work-out and gamify their life.

The GUI for this program is made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Tkinter-Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer/tree/master) 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install these modules. Usually PIP is insatlled with Python

Tkinter

```bash
pip install tk
```
PathLib

```bash
pip install pathlib
```

Psutil

```bash
pip install psutil
```

Pillow

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

Also Install all the fonts in the fonts folder to get the best experience.

## Usage

Run the gui.bat file in the main folder to start the program.

There is no help page or manual. Users are free to find things on their own

Please make sure that any new line of code works with all of the appropriate functions

I would also love any suggestions to the program
