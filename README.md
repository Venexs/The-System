# The System (Solo Levelling)
This is just a fun project I made, trying to emulate and fulfil the function that The 'System' in Solo Levelling had. (THIS IS JUST A TESTING VERSION!)

Context:

In the Anime/Manga/Light Novel, Solo Levelling, The MC has a screen only he can see that allows him to 'Level Up' his Physical Attributes such as, Strength, Agility, Vitality, Perception and Intellect. 

This Program is made to simulate that system by helping the user get motivation to work-out and gamify their life.

The GUI for this program is made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Tkinter-Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer/tree/master)
